The main objective of this work is to create an automated stock monitoring system. This system would fetch data from external providers. Fetched data then would be destructed and displayed as two formats: summarized and extended. In summarized format, common data is displayed. In extended format, full data is displayed along with historical price changes in graphical format. There will also be a currency converter in this system.
