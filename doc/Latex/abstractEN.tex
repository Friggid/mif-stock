The main objective of this work is to create an automated stock monitoring system. This system would fetch data from external providers. Fetched data then would be destructed and displayed as two formats: summarized and extended. In summarized format, common data is displayed. In extended format, full data is displayed along with historical price changes in graphical format. In addition, the system should provide user with ability to create personal stock portfolio which could be expanded by adding stock found with interactive search. To understand different stock prices, currency exchange functionality should be created.
